# PES2UG20CS914_JENKIN - Jenkins Pipeline Automation

Welcome to the Jenkins Pipeline Automation project! This repository is dedicated to streamlining Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes using Jenkins. Automate your builds, tests, and deployments effortlessly with this powerful Jenkins pipeline.

## üöÄ Features

- **Jenkins Pipeline:** Define a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment stages.
- **Version Control Integration:** Seamless integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) for codebase synchronization.
- **Docker Integration:** Containerize your applications for consistency across different environments.
- **Notification Alerts:** Receive alerts and notifications about build and deployment statuses.
- **Parameterized Builds:** Customize builds with parameters to adapt to various project configurations.
- **Security Scanning:** Integrate security scanning tools to ensure the integrity of your codebase.
- **Artifact Management:** Store and manage artifacts generated during the build process.
- **Multi-Branch Pipelines:** Manage and execute pipelines for different branches in your repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Jenkins:** Automation server for building, testing, and deploying projects.
- **Docker:** Containerization for application packaging and portability.
- **Git:** Version control system for source code management.
- **Pipeline DSL:** Define pipelines as code for reproducibility and version control.
- **Notifications Plugin:** Receive notifications about build and deployment outcomes.
- **Security Scanning Tools:** Integrate tools like SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check for code analysis.
- **Artifact Repository Manager:** Use tools like Nexus or JFrog Artifactory for artifact management.
- **Multi-Branch Pipeline Configuration:** Leverage Jenkins features for managing multi-branch pipelines.
